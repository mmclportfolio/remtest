The built-in tasks are simple to set up in Remediate. You can even create your own custom tasks.

After identifying a vulnerability, or set of vulnerabilities, you need to remediate, you can target the afflicted nodes with a Task. A Task is a script that the target node is able to execute, wrapped in metadata Remediate can consume.

Learn how to remediate a vulnerability using both built-in and custom tasks in this short tutorial.
