# Update a user

From time to time you might need to change a userâ€™s password, or update the groups assigned to their account.

To update a user account:

1.  In the main Remediate UI, click **User admin** on the navigation sidebar.

    The user admin login page is displayed.

2.  Log in with the administrator username and password.

3.  Select **Users** in the sidebar, and click **Edit** on the row assigned to the user account you want to edit.

4.  Make changes on the relevant tabs in the User page for the account.
