# Upload scripts

Uploaded Linux and Windows scripts are converted into tasks to run on vulnerable nodes and help fix vulnerabilities. To decrease task maintenance, combine scripts into one task that runs on both operating systems.

1.  On the sidebar, click **Manage tasks**, and then click **Add tasks**.

2.  On the Upload file page, select **Add Linux script** or **Add Windows script**.

3.  Select your script, and then click **Open**.

    **Tip:** If you upload both a Linux and Windows script, they are converted and combined into one task that can run on either operating system.

4.  Click **Add details**.

5.  On the Add details page, enter a name and description for the task.

6.  Click **Save task**.

    The Settings page appears, and your task is now available and is listed in the tasks table.
