        detected during a vulnerability scan. By monitoring the number of vulnerabilities and
        affected nodes, the risk score, and the analysis of each vulnerability, you can prioritize
        its remediation and manage your security resources efficiently.</shortdesc><prolog><author translate="no" type="creator">Eamonn Smith &lt;eamonn.smith@puppet.com&gt;</author></prolog><conbody><p>To help you examine the severity of the vulnerabilities in the context of each node, the
                <wintitle>Vulnerabilities</wintitle> dashboard provides a summary view of the most
            critical ones detected on your infrastructure. </p><p><note type="tip">By default, the dashboard automatically refreshes every 15 minutes. To change to a

                dashboard.</note></p><section><title>Vulnerabilities posing the highest risk to my infrastructure</title><p>A risk is a potential for loss, damage, or destruction of a node as a result of a threat
                exploiting a vulnerability. The risk score assigned to each vulnerability indicates
                the potential danger it poses to each node. It is based on the impact and
                possibility of exploit. </p><p>The <wintitle>Highest risk vulnerabilities</wintitle> dashboard card highlights the top 3 vulnerabilities detected on your infrastructure that have been assigned the highest risk score.</p><p>The <wintitle>Highest risk vulnerabilities</wintitle> page lists and orders vulnerabilities ranked by the assigned risk score  and by the number of nodes the vulnerability was detected on.</p><p><note type="important">The risk score is assigned by your vulnerability scanner. </note></p></section><section><title>Vulnerable nodes needing immediate attention</title><p>A top priority should be to fix a critical vulnerability in a node that’s considered extremely
                important. However, remediating the same vulnerability might not be a top priority
                if it’s present on a node of medium or low importance.</p><p>The <wintitle>Vulnerable nodes</wintitle> dashboard card highlights the most vulnerable nodes
                running on your infrastructure that might need immediate attention.</p><p>The <wintitle>Vulnerable nodes</wintitle> page lists and orders nodes ranked by the number of vulnerabilities detected on each node.</p></section><section><title>Vulnerabilities affecting a large percentage of my infrastructure</title><p>The <wintitle>Most common vulnerabilities</wintitle> dashboard card displays the top ten vulnerabilities that have been detected on a large number of nodes running on your infrastructure.  </p><p>The <wintitle>Most common vulnerabilities</wintitle> page lists and orders vulnerabilities  ranked by  the number of nodes the vulnerability is detected on.</p></section><section><title>Top vulnerabilities requiring remediation</title><p>The <wintitle>Top vulnerabilities</wintitle> dashboard card lists the top 5 vulnerabilities detected on nodes  running on your infrastructure. The vulnerability is ranked by the risk score assigned to it and the number of nodes it was detected on.</p><p><note type="important">The risk scores is calculated using the  risk score assigned by your
                    vulnerability scanner multiplied by the number of nodes it was detected
