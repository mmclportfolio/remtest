# Welcome to Puppet Remediateâ„¢

Remediate helps you minimize the risk of external attacks and data breaches by providing you visibility into the vulnerabilities across your infrastructure, and the tools to prioritize and take action. With Remediate, you can eliminate the repetitive and error-prone steps of manual data handovers between teams.

Remediate has the following capabilities built-in:

-   Shared vulnerability data: Integrating with Tenable, Qualys and Rapid7.

-   Risk-based prioritization: A dashboard that displays your most critical vulnerabilities, prioritized based on infrastructure context.

-   Tasks: Allowing you to fix vulnerabilities at scale. You can upload your own scripts for Remediate to convert to a task or use task-based modules from Puppet Forge.
