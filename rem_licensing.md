# Licensing

Puppet Remediate is a licensed product and is typically licensed per-node.

A node is defined as a single network-connected device such as a server, desktop, or laptop. Virtual machines that have a unique IP address are a separate node from the physical machine on which they reside.

Based on the number of licenses, Remediate maintains an equal number of node entries in its database. As nodes are identified, either from a scanner, or from an infrastructure source, it occupies a licensed node database entry. Remediate frees up database entries after they are missing from two consecutive data discovery polling cycles.

See the **License** page in the Remediate UI for details about your current Remediate license, including:

-   License ID
-   Activation and expiry dates
-   Current number of active nodes discovered by Remediate
-   Total nodes licensed
