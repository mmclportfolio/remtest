# Delete a user

Remediate administrators can delete other user accounts, including admin accounts.

To delete a user:

1.  In the main Remediate UI, click **User admin** on the navigation sidebar.

    The user admin login page is displayed.

2.  Log in with the administrator username and password.

3.  Select **Users** in the sidebar, and click **Delete** on the row assigned to the user account you want to remove.

4.  Click **Delete** on the pop-up dialog that appears to confirm.

    The user account is no longer displayed on the Users page.
