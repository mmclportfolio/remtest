                files and to include a username and passphrase for each file. Using an SSH private
                key file, rather than an SSH username and password, is considered more secure
                against potential compromises on remote nodes because the password is not sent over
                the network.</note></p><p>When using SSH authentication to discover resources running on <ph conkeyref="ProductNames/linux">Linux</ph> nodes, there are a number of prerequisites:<ul><li><p>To install the <ph conkeyref="ProductNames/puppet">Puppet</ph> agent on nodes, your SSH credentials must be for the root account.</p></li><li><p>To discover containers on nodes, your SSH credentials must be for the root account or an account that is a member of the Docker group.</p></li></ul></p></conbody></concept>
