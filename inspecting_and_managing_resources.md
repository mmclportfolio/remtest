# Discovering and managing resources

The Resources dashboard provides a high-level summary view of your infrastructure, and consists of a number of dashboard cards to drill down from for detailed information about nodes, packages, and containers.

**Remember:** To discover resources running on each node, you must provide SSH or WinRM credentials. See [Adding node credentials](adding_node_credentials.md).

-   **[Discovering resources](discovering_resources.md)**  
Discover node resources running on your infrastructure source account. Add your node credentials and discover node attributes, the system services, the users and groups belonging to each node, along with packages, tags, and containers.
-   **[Viewing resource details](viewing_resource_details.md#)**  
Puppet Remediate groups attributes associated with each discovered resource into a number of different facets to give you even more insights. A facet represents a set of related attributes, each one independently maintained, that describe a certain aspect of a discovered node.
-   **[Filtering and exporting data](filter_export_data.md#)**  
Create custom filters and customize table views to view resource data most important to you, or for backup purposes, export data to a CSV file.
